# Programming-Resources
This repo is dedicated to programming resources I might find helpful while learning something new or better understanding a concept.
---
Items you might find in here (eventually):
* Django quick start guide
* Python SQLite3 quick start guide
* Misc. C++ items
* Algorithms and Data Structures (Probably in C++)

---
Any suggestions are welcome for this repo. It serves as a way for me to better learn by reading through documentation and getting hands-on experience.
